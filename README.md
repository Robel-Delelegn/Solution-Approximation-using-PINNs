# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Function Approximation

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) designed to approximate a function based on a given differential equation. 
PINNs leverage the underlying physics described by the differential equations directly within the loss function, allowing for effective function approximation and solving problems constrained by physical laws.

## Features

- **PINN Model**: Implements a neural network that incorporates the differential equation into the loss function.
- **Function Approximation**: Trains the network to approximate a function that satisfies the given differential equation.
- **Example Application**: Demonstrates the model's ability to solve a specific differential equation problem.
- **Visualization**: Provides tools for visualizing the training process and results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x (or another deep learning library of your choice)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration
